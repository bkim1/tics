Implements a simple distributed system for verifying hash-based puzzle solutions. Includes a simple server (verifier) and client (solver) where the client sends its solved puzzle to the server to get confirmation that it is a valid solution.

## How to Run

1. Setup the repo if necessary (check the main page README for instructions)
2. Navigate to the homework 3 folder using `cd hw3`
3. Run the server (verifier) using `python puzzle_verifier.py`
4. Run the client (solver) using `python puzzle_solver.py`
